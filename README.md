# POC Hockey Game

This repository contains a proof-of-concept hockey game developed using [Matter.js](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js), a 2D physics engine for the web, along with [Matter-attractors](https://github.com/liabru/matter-attractors), a plugin to add gravitational attraction and repulsion forces to Matter.js bodies.

## Getting Started
```
git pull git@github.com:evanmeeks/centrifugal-force-table-hockey.git && cd centrifugal-force-table-hockey && npm run start
```

  [Demo](https://centrifugal-magnet-hockey-app.netlify.app/)
 
## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to move the paddles.
- Score goals by hitting the puck into the opposing goal.
- The first player to score 5 goals wins the match.
- To magnetize the puck to the paddle, hold the down arrow key.

## Built With

- [Matter.js](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js) - The physics engine powering the game dynamics.
- [Matter-attractors](https://github.com/liabru/matter-attractors) - Used to simulate attractive forces in the game.
